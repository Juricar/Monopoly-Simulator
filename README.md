# Monopoly-Simulator
A Monopoly Simulator Coded by me, but inspired by a YouTube video by standupmaths.
Creates a class "Player" that the code then commands to play 100,000 turns of monopoly, recording the rolls, and spaces landed on.
This information is then presented where the number of times a square was landed on, and the percent of the game the Player landed on the sqare is visible.
